# String Transformers

This is a collection of string transformers, all of which implement a `transform` method that takes a string and returns another.

Some are generic: `CapitalLettersExtractor` removes non-capital letters from a string.  Others are geared towards handling scientific names, like `StripBasionymAuthorTransformer`.

**See the [String-Transformers Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/RBGKew/String-Transformers/wiki) or [API Documentation](https://rbgkew.github.io/String-Transformers/apidocs/0.2.0/) for further documentation.**

## Usage with OpenRefine

The transformers can be used with [OpenRefine](http://www.openrefine.org/).  [Download the JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/kew/rmf/string-transformers/0.2.0/string-transformers-0.2.0.jar)
and [Apache Commons-Lang3 JAR](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/commons/commons-lang3/3.3.2/commons-lang3-3.3.2.jar) and
put both in OpenRefine's `webapp/extensions/jython/module/MOD-INF/lib` directory, then (re)start OpenRefine.

Use expressions like this, after selecting _Jython_ from the Language dropdown:

```python
from org.kew.rmf.transformers import CapitalLettersExtractor

cle = CapitalLettersExtractor()
return cle.transform(value)
```

## Usage in other software

The library is published in the Maven Central Repository:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.kew.rmf</groupId>
	<artifactId>string-transformers</artifactId>
